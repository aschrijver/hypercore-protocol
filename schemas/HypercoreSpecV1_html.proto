/**
 * The SLEEP format is designed to allow for sparse replication, meaning you
 * can efficiently download only the metadata and data required to resolve a
 * single byte region of a single file, which makes Dat suitable for a wide
 * variety of streaming, real time and large dataset use cases.
 *
 * To take advantage of this, Dat includes a network protocol. It is message
 * based and stateless, making it possible to implement on a variety of network
 * transport protocols including UDP and TCP.
 *
 * Both metadata and content registers in SLEEP share the exact same
 * replication protocol.<br>
 * Individual messages are encoded using Protocol Buffers and there are ten
 * message types in total.
 *
 * Over the wire messages are packed in the following lightweight
 * container format:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     &lt;varint - length of rest of message&gt;
 *       &lt;varint - header&gt;
 *       &lt;message&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * The <code>header</code> value is a single varint that has two pieces of information,
 * the integer type that declares a 4-bit message type (used below), and a
 * channel identifier, 0 for metadata and 1 for content.
 *
 * To generate this varint, you bitshift the 4-bit type integer onto the end of
 * the channel identifier, e.g. channel &lt;&ltl 4 | &lt;4-bit-type&gt;.
